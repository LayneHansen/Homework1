# refactor_accessibiility project

The purpose of this project was to make minor modificaitons to an already-existing website for Horiseon. They specialize in SEO (Search Engine Optimization), online reputation management, and social media marketing. 

The biggest thing I learned from this project is attention to small details. Two links in the header worked properly; a third did not. It took a few minutes of comparing the commands in the html file, but I finally discovered the third link wasn't working because it was missing the 'class' command within the div tag.

I also learned the importance of clean code. The source code was clumped and didn't allow the reader to easily spot potential errors. I made small changes to make it appear cleaner in editor to make future changes easier.

I also learned, peripherally, there are things developers can do to assist their clients, i.e., they have a differentiation between text color in their company name. The 'seo' is a different color than the rest of the letters in their business name. I made the contrast between the two because, to the naked eye, it was difficult to see they wanted 'seo' to stand out. It's a clever choice, but the lack of contrast nullified it. I think there are other potential improvements to be made to this site, but those would need to be discussed with the client before those changes would be made.
